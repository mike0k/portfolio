                <p>Hello, I'm Michael and I'm a web developer living in Edinburgh. I've been building websites commercially for over 4 years and have spent the majority of the past year working as a senior developer for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.evolution-online.co.uk">Evolution Online</a>. During this time I have developed a large number of websites that involved a wide variety of CMS and eCom solutions as well as significantly upgrading the company's base solution. I have also worked on a freelance basis, taking clients through their project form start to finish.</p>
