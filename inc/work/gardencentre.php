						The Manchester Garden Centre website was a small personal project I made up during my time off from university. I created it to test my use of image fading, database linked tables and css rollover menu's. I was also interested to see just how quickly i could create a simple commercial site to which I even surprised myself by managing to create the whole site in under 3 days.
